sentimentAnalysis1 fails between reviews 3000-4000 when it gets 2 reviews
for the same business. When it tries to find the existing sentiment the
value property fails to resolve. Is the node properly storing the sentiment
object or is the sentiment array in the YelpDataContainer object storing
sentiments instead of nodes.

Wtf.
